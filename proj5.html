                As a driven and curious student at Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), Vellore, my name is <strong class="important">Mansi Kumari</strong>. I am currently in my <span class="highlight">second year of B.Tech, specializing in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) Core</span>. My passion for coding and innovative technologies has been a significant driving force in my academic and personal life. With a strong foundation in programming languages and web development, I am eager to <span class="highlight">explore new technologies and collaborate on impactful projects</span>. My coursework has provided me with a solid <b>understanding of various programming languages, including Python, Java, and C++, as well as web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</b>.
